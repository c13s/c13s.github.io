<div>It seems I need to sleep more .<br /><blockquote><p>Lose weight while you sleep? It sounds too good to be trueâ€”but recent research indicates that there is a connection between how much you weigh and the amount of shut-eye you get per night.</p>Two hormones, ghrelin and leptin, help to control appetite. When you do not get enough rest, levels of ghrelin, which increases hunger, rise; levels of leptin, which promotes feelings of fullness, sink. <br /></blockquote> <br /><a href='http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=you-snooze-you-lose-weight'>You Snooze, You Lose -- Weight: Scientific American</a><br /><br><br><div class='zemanta-pixie'><img src='http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=5ee03058-ffff-86df-9caf-691205b2c7e0' alt=''></div></div>
