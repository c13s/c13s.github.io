Then they found that the offsprings of these enriched knockout mice associated the electric shock with the cage.More details at:<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126945.100-can-experiences-be-passed-on-to-offspring.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news">Can experiences be passed on to offspring? - life - 06 February 2009 - New Scientist</a>
