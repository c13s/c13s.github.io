This summer I am working on a GSoC project (Gene Expression Reader plugin) for cytoscape again, and as a GSoC student, I got a chance to go to the <a href="http://cytoscape.wodaklab.org/wiki/CytoscapeRetreat2010">2010 Cytoscape summer retreat</a> in Ann Arbor Michigan, and met several mentors, and listened to several very interesting talks. <br /><br />I talked to Alex Pico, my direct mentor on the Express Reader plugin, also Scooter and Daniele. The face to face meeting turns out to be very efficient :) and we clarified several uncertainties in the project design. It's also interesting to learn some history of the Cytoscape, and link faces to some familiar names in mailing lists. <br /><br />One of the interesting talk is about a cytoscape plugin that can explore open linked data (LOD), given by Eric Neumann. He talked about a SPARQL plugin that can be used to query LOD data, and gave quite a few case studies on how to use the plugin to query and visualize data that are related to drug discovery.&nbsp; It was related to the work that is being done in the Wild's group I worked with last year (chem2bio2rdf). Although I am not actively involved in that project any more, it's exciting to see that the data could be potentially put into real use. <br /><br />Dr Lee Hood gave a inspiring talk on the future role of systems biology to <a href="http://www.systemsbiology.org/intro_to_isb_and_systems_biology/Predictive_Preventive_Personalized_and_Participatory">P4 medicine</a> (predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory). There are several other interesting talks and fun posters too. <br /><br />Finally, the location of the meeting was in a big research building that was belong to Pfizer, and was recently bought to UM, but was still pretty much vacant. It's a huge building and very nice facilities, but so quiet as we are the only group of people in it. <br />

Update on 9/3: It seems the videos of all talks are uploaded now (<a href="http://cytoscape.wodaklab.org/wiki/CytoscapeRetreat2010">http://cytoscape.wodaklab.org/wiki/CytoscapeRetreat2010</a>)
