<div>A paper published on JCIM discusses issues with manipulating chemical names in various languages, including English, German, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Polish and Hungarian, in the openeye software lexichem. The method they are using is rule-based. There are a set of rules for each language, to and from English. To translate between two non-english languages, English is used like a lingua franca - for example, to translate between Japanese to Chinese, the chemical name has to be translated from Japanese to English, and then English to Chinese.
