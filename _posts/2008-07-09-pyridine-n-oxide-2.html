The interesting thing about this compound is its smiles. Both O=n1ccccc1 and [O-][n-]1cccc1 represents this compound, well kind of the two forms of this compound. The interpretation of the two smiles are common caveats in many cheminformatics tools. Right now, CDK can only correctly parse the second form of smiles, not the first one. On the contrary, the smi2gif web service at UCSF can only convert the first smiles to a gif image. However, the image is really a direct representation of "O=n1cccc1" (show as below). <img src="http://chimeraservices.compbio.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/smi2gif.cgi?smiles=O=n1ccccc1&amp;width=200&amp;height=200&amp;bgcolor=white" border="1" /><a href="http://chimeraservices.compbio.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/smi2gif.cgi?smiles=O=n1ccccc1&amp;width=200&amp;height=200&amp;bgcolor=white">http://chimeraservices.compbio.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/smi2gif.cgi?smiles=O=n1ccccc1&amp;width=200&amp;height=200&amp;bgcolor=white</a>Pyridine-N-Oxide derivatives are inhibitory to HIV and SARS.
